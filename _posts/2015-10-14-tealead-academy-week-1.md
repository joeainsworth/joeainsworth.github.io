With the exception of the Pragmatic Studio Ruby course, which I highly recommend, I've spent a fair amount of time reading books and following tutorials on programming, but found nothing really stuck. It wasn't until I took the Pragmatic course that I really realised I needed a more structured approach to learning, one that gave me a solid grounding in the fundamentals. Whats more, the Pragmatic course was really enjoyable and as we all know, when you enjoy something you're prepared to put in a whole lot more effort and work! Because my ultimate goal is to become a full stack developer I needed to find something that took me from Ruby through to Rails with a dash of HTML, CSS and Javascript for good measure.

I can't remember how but I found the Tealeaf Academy and extensive Google searches revealed just how highly regarded the course was amongst students and alumni. The whole curriculum takes place online and promises a well crafted learning experience and roadmap to become a confident developer. Having just completed the first of three courses this is a sentiment I would echo.

The main tutor Chris Lee is excellent and there are also very helpful teaching assistants available that assist you as you progresss through the course.
