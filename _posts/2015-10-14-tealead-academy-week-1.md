With the exception of the Pragmatic Studio Ruby course, which I highly recommend, I've spent a fair amount of time reading books and following tutorials on programming, but found nothing really stuck. It wasn't until I took the Pragmatic course that I really realised I needed a more structured approach to learning, one that gave me a solid grounding in the fundamentals. Whats more, the Pragmatic course was really enjoyable and as we all know, when you enjoy something you're prepared to put in a whole lot more effort and work! Because my ultimate goal is to become a full stack developer I needed to find something that took me from Ruby through to Rails with a dash of HTML, CSS and Javascript for good measure.

I can't remember how but I found the Tealeaf Academy. Extensive Google searches revealed just how highly regarded the course was amongst students and alumni. The whole curriculum takes place online and is split into three courses,

1. Introduction to Ruby and Web Development
2. Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails
3. Build Robust and Production Quality Applications

The courses promise a well crafted learning experience and a roadmap to become a confident developer. Having just completed the first week this is a sentiment I would echo.

Prior to undertaking the first week of the "Introduction to Ruby and Web Development" course there is a prep work to complete which includes reading books and completing exercises on the following,

1. [Intro to Programming with Ruby](https://www.gotealeaf.com/books/ruby)
2. [Oject Orientated Programming with Ruby](https://www.gotealeaf.com/books/oo_ruby)

There are loads more books with high quality content published by Tealeaf available to [read here](https://www.gotealeaf.com/books).

Anyway, Tealeafs main tutor Chris Lee is excellent. There are also very helpful teaching assistants that are available to assist you as you progresss through the course. In addition to the regular curriculam there are live sessions every week and the TAs are often available within the chat room for support or advice if required. The course is split into weeks area on the website with it's own bulletin board. Here you can ask questions and request code reviews and usually within 12 hours or less you'll have a response to your question. Every time I requested a code review the feedback I had was invaluable. It is a really good way of learning, I'd find myself requesting a code review for a recently completed exercise then moving on to the next assignment. Half way through the next assignment I'd get a notification that my code had been reviewed. I'd check out the review, make changes, refactor my code and push it to Github for another review. Jumping back to a previous assignment keeps you on the ball, it means reloading the code into your brain and working through it, this is something I'm told professional developers do everyday.

Anyway, we worked through several Ruby programs of increasing difficulty by utilising previous knowledge. Pulling all this knowledge together to build programs is another skill in itself and requires problem solving and analytical skills. Students are encouraged to use pseudo code before attempting an exercise, a technique that worked well for me. I was able to code up each exercise before looking at the solutions to rework some of my logic and refactor for efficiencies.

If you're interested in the projects I made in week 1 I've compiled a list with a link through to my Github repos,

1. [Calculator](https://github.com/joeainsworth/ta-tic-tac-toe)
2. [Paper, Rock, Scissors](https://github.com/joeainsworth/ta-rock-paper-scissors)
3. [Tic, Tac, Toe](https://github.com/joeainsworth/ta-tic-tac-toe)
4. [Blackjack](https://github.com/joeainsworth/ta-blackjack)

Next week focuses on OOP and we will transform the Blackjack game into OOP code!
