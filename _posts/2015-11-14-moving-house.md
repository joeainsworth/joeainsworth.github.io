## Moving house

I've moved house recently and the house I've moved into has needed lots of work doing. We've had to rip the kitchen out and rebuild it. It's taken a little while and still isn't complete. Decorating and tidying has taken up most of my time, especially whilst still working, everything has to take place at the weekends and during the evenings. Now that a majority of the work is done I've got enough time to commit myself to the next course on Tealeaf Academy, "Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails". I'll keep you all updated, I'm going to get stuck into some SQL..
