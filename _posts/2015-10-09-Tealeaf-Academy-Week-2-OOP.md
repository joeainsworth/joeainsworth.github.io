We're delving into Object Orientated Programming (OOP) in week 2 at Tealeaf Academy. OOP is pretty bad ass, it's an entirely new way to organise code and has immense benefits.

Personally I found OOP quite simple and it seemed to make way more sense than procedural programming. The code is easier to understand, more efficient and there is less reptition. As programmers we are constantly told not to repeat ourselves, you'll see the accroynm DRY (don't repeat yourself) all over the place in the world of code. Using OOP it's quite easy to minimise repetition and create code that is easier to maintain and reuse.

We got down to turning our procedural Tic Tac Toe and Blackjack games into OOP code. It was hard but pretty darn cool compared to procedural.
