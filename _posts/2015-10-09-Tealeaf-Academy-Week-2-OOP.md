We're delving into Object Orientated Programming (OOP) this week at Tealeaf Academy. OOP is pretty bad ass, it's an entirely new way to organise code but has immense benefits.

Personally I found OOP quite simple and to me it made way more sense than procedural programming. The code is easier to understand, more efficient and there is less reptition. As programmers we are constantly told to not repeat yourself, so much so it has been given the accronym DRY. Using OOP it's quite easy to minimise repetition and create code that is easier to maintain.

We got down to turning our procedural Tic Tac Toe and Blackjack into OOP code and it was hard at first but pretty darn cool compared to procedural.
