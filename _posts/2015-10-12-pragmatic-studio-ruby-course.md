## Learning Ruby with the Pragmatic Programmers

I decided to take the relatively inexpensive plunge and invested in the Pragmatic Studio's Learn Ruby course. 

The course is hosted by Mike and Nicole Clark. Mike is a great tutor and Nicole, although less involved, is also pretty good. The two of them work really well together and it is definetely more interesting have two tutors. 

I read a little bit about the course in various places online and found it was frequently referenced with only good things said about it so decided it was worth a go!

Priced at $169 this equates to around Â£110 which isn't bed considering the breadth of the course. Every topic is covered and explained. The course is perfect for those who have a little programming experience with other languages. Those without any experience may find themselves lost quite quickly. 20+ videos take your through the fundamentals of Ruby including variables, control and flow right through to test driven development, modules and building your own gems. You move from procedural coding to object orientated programming.

Towards the later of the course I found things a bit tricky, mainly because most of the advanced concepts were new to me. 

You code two programs in parrallel, one project is built whilst watching the videos. The other is built using the concepts from the video as part of the post video exercises which really helps to reinforce what you've watched.

There is an extra project students can work through but I will come back to this in the future.

I would highly recommend the course to all.
