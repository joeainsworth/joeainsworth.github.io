## Learning Ruby with the Pragmatic Programmers

I decided to take the relatively inexpensive plunge and invested in the Pragmatic Studio's Learn Ruby course. 

The course is hosted by Mike and Nicole Clark. Mike is a great tutor and Nicole, although less involved, is also pretty good. The two of them work really well together and it is definetely more interesting have two tutors. 

I read a little bit about the course and heard some good things, in various forums and on different websites the course was frequently referenced. 

Priced at $169 this equates to around Â£110 which isn't bed considering the breadth of the course. Every topic is covered and explained. The course is perfect for those who have a little programming experience with other languages. Those without any experience may find themselves lost quite quickly. 20+ videos take your through the fundamentals of Ruby including variables, control and flow right through to test driven development, modules and building your own gems.

Towards the later of the course I found things a bit tricky, mainly because most of the advanced concepts were new to me. 

Two programs are built in parrallel, one project is built whilst watching the videos and the other is built using the same concepts but in a different context as part of the post video exercises and this helps to reinforce these concepts.

There is also an extra project you can work through but I will come back to this in the future.

I would highly recommend the course to all.
