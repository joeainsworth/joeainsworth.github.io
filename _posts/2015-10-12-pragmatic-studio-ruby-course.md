[front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)

I decided to take the relatively inexpensive plunge and invested in the [Pragmatic Studio's Ruby](https://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby) course. 

The course is hosted by Mike and Nicole Clark. Mike is a great tutor and Nicole, his sidekick (and wife), is also pretty good. The two of them work really well together and it is definetely more interesting having the two tutors. 

When spending some time Googling about Ruby and it's many learning resources the course by Pragmatic is often referred too on blogs and in reviews. Come to think of it I can't remember reading one negative comment about the course.

Priced at $169 this equates to around Â£110 which I thought was extremely considering the breadth of the course. Every topic is covered and explained very well. It is perfect for those who have some exposure to programming with other languages. Those without any experience may find themselves lost fairly quickly. The 20+ videos are fun and take you through the fundamentals of Ruby syntax including variables, control and flow right through to test driven development (TDD), modules and building your own gems. The course moves quickly from procedural to object orientated programming.

Towards the latter of the course things got a bit tricky, mainly because the advanced topics were new to me. Programming isn't necesserally hard but you do need persistance and multiple exposure to topics. It is this exposure that helps build essential muscle memory.

You code two programs in parrallel, one project is built whilst watching videos. The other is used to reinforce the topics covered in the earlier videos and really helps to reinforce these concepts. There is an extra project students can work through and I will be coming back to this in the future. I followed all the exercises and pushed them to Github, you'll get a good idea about the content of the course by following [this link](https://github.com/joeainsworth/programming_exercises/tree/master/Pragmatic%20Studo%20-%20Ruby%20Programming) to my repo.

Overall this is a great course for anybody who wants to get in Ruby. I would imagine even the most experienced developers will find the course useful to quickly get a grasp on the Ruby syntax and expressive style of programming. **Would recommend.**
