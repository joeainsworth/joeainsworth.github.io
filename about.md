Hello! 

My name is Joe Ainsworth and I'm based in Truro, Cornwall. I have a background in ecommerce but really enjoy coding.

I'm self-training to become a full stack web developer using online resources only. There has been a big rise in coding bootcamps but they're super expensive and most of them are based in London.

Whilst some of the resources I use may not be free I've spent a lot of time researching some of the best. The aim is to blog my journey with the hope of helping or inspiring others. I'll review the resources and let you know if I'd recommend them.

Eventually I would love to be able to work on software projects or applications with other developers that share the same passions. One day I might launch my own product. Either way, doing something I enjoy for a career is the ultimate goal!
