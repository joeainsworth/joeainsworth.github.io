I'm Joe, a student at <a href="http://www.launchschool.com">Launch School</a> where I'm on a long, windy but enjoyable path to a career in software development all being well. Launch School trains aspiring software developers by slowly building up proficiency in fundamentals, while at the same time exposing students to new workflows and practices. My blog will primarily document this journy.
